// Users can stake ether in ReadOnlyPool
// For each ether they contribute to the pool, they are minted an equal amount of
// LPToken.
//
// However, when the pool earns ETH, there will be more ETH
// in the pool than there are LPTokens.
//
// When someone wants to redeem their ETH, they burn their LPTokens using
// the `removeLiquidity` function. They are returned a pro-rata share of the ETH in the pool.
//
// For example, if someone deposits 100 ETH into a pool that already has 900 ETH,
// they will get back 100 LP tokens. If the pool earns 100 more ETH, there are 1000 LPTokens
// in existence, but 1,100 ETH in the pool. When someone redeems 100 LPTokens, they will actually get
// $110 ETH. (100 / 1000 == 110 / 1100).
//
// The value of an LPToken can be retrieved with `getVirtualPrice()`. As more ETH is added to the pool,
// while the supply of LP tokens is constant, the value of the LP token goes up.
//
// Because there are always at least as much ETH in the pool as there are LPTokens,
// LPTokens are always worth at least 1 ETH.
//
// Or so it seems...

// Note: This CTF was inspired by the Curve oracle attack, but has been simplified as much as possible
// to get to the core of the vulnerability, and some details have been changed. There is a flaw in this
// implementation where users instantly earn rewards if they deposit ETH into a pool that has already
// received profit, but that is not the vulnerability we are trying to exploit here.
